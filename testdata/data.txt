For everything there is a season,
and a time for every matter under heaven:
A time to be born,
and a time to die;
A time to plant,
and a time to pluck up that what is planted;
A time to kill,
and a time to heal;
A time to break down,
and a time to build up;
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh;
A time to mourn,
and a time to dance;
A time to throw away stones,
and a time to gather stones together;
A time to embrace,
and a time to refrain from embracing;
A time to seek,
and a time to lose;
A time to keep,
and a time to cast away;
A time to tear,
and a time to sew;
A time to keep silence,
and a time to speak;
A time to love,
and a time to hate;
A time for war;
and a time for peace.
